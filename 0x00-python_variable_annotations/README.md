Project Description
In this project, the objective is to understand and implement variable annotations in Python. Variable annotations were introduced in Python 3.6, allowing developers to add type hints to variables, making the code more readable and maintainable.

Similarly, the project focuses on enhancing Python programming skills by the implemention of variable annotations. Variable annotations help in specifying the type of data a variable can hold, enabling better static code analysis and improving code documentation.

Concepts Covered

Variable Annotations: Understanding the syntax and usage of variable annotations in Python.
Type Hints: Implementing type hints for variables to improve code readability.
Static Type Checking: Utilizing tools like mypy to perform static type checking on annotated variables.
Documentation: Writing clear and concise documentation explaining the purpose and usage of variable annotations.
